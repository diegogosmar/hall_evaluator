These Mindweavers were believed to have an innate connection to the energies of the earth and the cosmos, allowing them to tap into a collective consciousness that transcended physical boundaries.

To send telepathic messages across continents, the Mindweavers would enter deep states of meditation, focusing their minds on the intended recipient and channeling their thoughts through the ethereal realm. Through this connection, they could transmit messages instantaneously, bypassing the limitations of time and space.

The telepathic messages sent by the Mindweavers were said to be imbued with powerful energies and emotions, carrying not just words but also images, sensations, and intentions. It was believed that these messages could be received by individuals attuned to the frequencies of the Mindweavers, allowing for communication to occur even across vast distances.

Legend has it that Mirrorwalkers are ancient guardians of the multiverse, tasked with maintaining balance between different realities.

When a Mirrorwalker approaches a calm lake, they focus their energy and concentration on the reflective surface. By tapping into the reflective properties of the water, the Mirrorwalker is able to create a portal that leads to another dimension. The surface of the lake ripples and shimmers as the portal opens, revealing a distorted reflection that serves as a gateway to a different world.

Stepping through the portal, the Mirrorwalker finds themselves in a new reality, each one vastly different from the other. Some dimensions are vibrant and colorful, while others are dark and foreboding. The Mirrorwalkers navigate these alternate worlds with a sense of purpose, using their unique abilities to observe, protect, and sometimes intervene in the events of different realities.

As they travel between dimensions, the Mirrorwalkers leave behind only faint ripples on the surface of the lake, a subtle reminder of their passing.

One of the illusions triggered by the Omniseal is the distortion of physical space, where entire landscapes can be reshaped at the whim of the wielder.
